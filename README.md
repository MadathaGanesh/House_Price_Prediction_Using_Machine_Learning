# House_Price_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning
# This project is about creating a machine learning model that can predict the house value based on the given dataset.
# We use different types of Machine Learning algorithms such as linear regression , decision tree and random forest algorithms to train the model.
# The model that gives the best performance is used to predict the house value for new data.
# House price prediction can help the developer to determine the selling price of a house and can help the customer to arrange the right time to purchase a house.
# The platform that we use for predicting the correct data is Jupiter and Google Colab.
